	title = Base Not What It Seems
	agent = United Kerbal Army
	
	description = We  took a closer look at those surveillance photos you took of that forward base, and we realized it has no radar of any kind! And why, you ask, does it not have radar? Because it is a decoy, and we've been tricked! I guess they wanted to see what our capabilities technology-wise are, and from their troop movements, they are obviously not impressed. It looks for sure that they are going to attack, and they have deployed a large high-altitude spyplane with AWACS radar capabilities to survey the battlefield. Use these experimental high-altitude jets to get up there, but be careful because it has an armed drone escort. If you want, you can destroy the decoy base, but it is not neccesary to the mission. Good luck, you'll need it!
	
	synopsis = Destroy the high altitude spyplane and the drone protecting it. 
	
	notes = Use the experimental high-altitude jets, and destroy the decoy base if you want some extra spesos.
	
	completedMessage = Nice! This is our oppurtunity to gain the upper hand!
